        </div> 
        <div id="aboutparagraph" class="ab2">
            <p>In the same way that the Graeae Sisters shared one singular eye, the Graeae smart contact lens hopes to provide the same shared, seamless, and integrated experience with users. Designed to assist people with monocular vision, Graeae encompasses an all-in-one investment for the long term. With individualized user calibration and sonar scanning technology, this smart lens acts as an ocular assistant and safety device.</p>
            <p>In order to adjust to each individual user’s experience, Graeae begins with a calibration test. This test is done through instructed head movements and an initial scan of Graeae’s printed code. In this way, the lens is able to manipulate and account for any loss of depth and field perception and integrate it into all future navigations of space. With the smart lens sitting comfortably on the functional eye, sonar technology is then used to scan the user’s surrounding space for possible risks of injury. Users may also customize alerts in ways such as vibration, visual crosshairs, colors, and opacities.</p>
            <p>Current contact lenses do not account for those living with single eye vision. The goal of Graeae is to allow monocular vision users to save their time, energy, and money for what matters in their day. The future is here, and with an affordable investment like Graeae, health can be accessible, personal, and clear as day.</p>

            <h5>Smart Iris</h5>
            <p>Rip-resistant conductors operate microscopic smart technology for monocular vision users.</p>
            <h5>Depth and Field Calibration</h5>
            <p>Calibration is done, not only through instructed head movements, but also through Graeae's provided code. users stand 10 feet away and look at the cod, allowing it to process for approximately three minutes. Blinking is allowed, and users are encourages to relax durinf the process. Calibration sllows for the lens to adjust to the depth and fiels of the individual user.</p>
            <h5>Sonar Technology</h5>
            <p>Any risks of injuries or safety threats will be indicated with a crosshair and outlines visual. The crosshair feature moves to lead the user to the risk's direction, even if it is beyond the peripheral view. When the risk is located, an outline and low opacity will indicate the specific object.</p>
            <h5>Custom Settings</h5>
            <p>Users may change the color and opacity styles in Graeae's settings. Alert styles, such as the in-lens soft vibration or the blinking crosshair, may also be toggled on and off.</p>

            With the smart lens sitting comfortably on the functional eye, sonar technology is used to scan the user’s surrounding space in search for possible risks of injury. Soundwaves are sent out and that are bounced back. The length it takes for the return to be detected allows for our technology to detect the shape. Similar technology has been used in detecting large masses in the water however not to the extent that Graeae has.<br><br>
            To provide the most natural and least jarring experience, any detected risks will be warned through a soft vibration in the lens. An optional visual warning, in the form of a small crosshair, may also be toggled in the user settings. Looking at its direction will provide a zoomed in view while also providing a very thin, low-opacity outline of the obstacle.</p>

                <pa>Elena is a 68 year old woman who has been retired from teaching for nearly 5 years. 3 years ago, she suffered from an ocular infarction, which left her suddenly with monocular vision. Although she was able to attend ocular therapy and somewhat exercise her coordination in the first year, her growing age has made the sight loss even more difficult. She enjoys gardening and pottery, but still finds herself dropping tools or feeling strained without automatic functions.

                On Christmas, her grandson bought her a Graeae smart lens and even helped her calibrate it within an hour. Although she was initially hesitant on wearing a contact lens instead of a pair of glasses, she found herself forgetting that she was even using a visual accommodation. Her eyes did not feel sore, nor did she have to worry about her heavy glasses sliding off of her nose while gardening. When she reaches for her pottery tools or works with a rotating pottery wheel, she is able to accurately grip at the clay and shape it without multiple tries. Having an expanded periphery and detector has also prevented her from tripping over her cat multiple times.

                <pa>Eno is a 21 year-old man in his last year of college who has a relatively stable living situation due to his parents. Ever since he was born, he has suffered from monocular vision but it was only recently that Eno realized his vision was not normal after conversing with his friends. He was unconsciously able to adapt to the situation by turning his head to obtain clear vision. Since he spent a majority of his childhood with the nanny, his parents were not able to notice any abnormalities. Eno was always lacking in physical abilities, from kicking a soccer ball to even kicking up a pencil but always laughed it off as one of his quirks. 

                After learning about his condition, Eno started Googling possible solutions for monocular vision and came across the Graeae smart lenses. Excited to learn that there was even a possible solution, he quickly swiped his card and waited in anticipation. When the package arrived, he quickly set up the calibration and went outside to see the difference. What many take for granted, left Eno in awe. No more annoyances, no more tilting of his head to get a better view. His eyes finally felt like it worked for him, not the other way around.
